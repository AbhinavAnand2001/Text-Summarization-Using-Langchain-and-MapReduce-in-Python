# Text-Summarization-Using-Langchain-and-MapReduce-in-Python
A scalable tool for summarizing large documents using Langchain and the MapReduce technique. The project splits text into chunks, generates summaries with language models (e.g., GPT), and combines them into a cohesive final summary, optimizing for large datasets through parallel processing.
